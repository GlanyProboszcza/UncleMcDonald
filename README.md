I have approximately 5 months of actual hands-on expierence (academy, labs etc) with IT and IT Security.
Before that I was highly exposed (in a more passive way) to the industry already few years before (thanks to my husbands profession).
Now, after 5 months of intense academy related to CyberSecurity I am eager to use the planned 1-year period of my deliberate unemployment to extend my IT knowledge even more. That is why I am starting to learn how to code, use version control not only download stuff from github etc.
